#Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:
#Returns an empty list if n <= 0
#You can assume n will be always an integer

#   [1,1]   
#  [1,2,1]      (x+y)^0 =   x(squared)+ 2xy + y(squared)= 1+2+1
# [1,3,3,1]
#[1,4,6,4,1]
#pascals- Each new number lies between two numbers and below them,
#and its value is the sum of the two numbers above it.
