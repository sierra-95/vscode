It seems like you've provided a detailed description of a project related to network security and sniffing unencrypted
traffic. This project involves using a script called "user_authenticating_into_server" to perform authentication
steps on a server and then using tcpdump to sniff the network and find a password.
The goal is to find the password used in the authentication process and paste it into your answer file.

You'll need to execute the "user_authenticating_into_server" script locally on a Linux machine
(such as your Ubuntu vagrant machine). The script will perform authentication steps similar to the ones you've
described using telnet to interact with an SMTP server. Your task is to capture the network traffic using tcpdump
while the authentication process takes place and find the password used in the communication.

Please proceed responsibly and only perform these actions within your own controlled environment.
