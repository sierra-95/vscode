Isaac Newton was the first to glimpse this secret of the universe. He found
that the orbits of the planets, the rhythm of the tides, and the trajectories of
cannonballs could all be described, explained, and predicted by a small set of
differential equations. Today we call them Newton’s laws of motion and gravity.
Ever since Newton, we have found that the same pattern holds whenever we
uncover a new part of the universe. From the old elements of earth, air, fire, and
water to the latest in electrons, quarks, black holes, and superstrings, every
inanimate thing in the universe bends to the rule of differential equations. I bet
this is what Feynman meant when he said that calculus is the language God
talks. If anything deserves to be called the secret of the universe, calculus is it.
By inadvertently discovering this strange language, first in a corner of
geometry and later in the code of the universe, then by learning to speak it
fluently and decipher its idioms and nuances, and finally by harnessing its
forecasting powers, humans have used calculus to remake the world.
That’s the central argument of this book.
