------------PSEUDO-CLASS-----------------
When you want to target a specific state of an element, like when a user hovers over a button,
you use a "pseudo-class."
This is like a special state that you want to style differently. To indicate that you're targeting a pseudo-class,
 like the hover state, you use a full colon (:) after the selector.
So, in your case:

filters alone: You're selecting an element with the ID filters and applying styles to it directly.
No full colon needed because you're just styling the element itself.

filters button: hover: You're selecting a button inside the element with the ID filters and targeting its hover state.
You use the full colon to indicate that you're dealing with the special state of the button when it's being hovered over.

Remember, the full colon (:) is a way to tell CSS that you're either selecting a pseudo-class (like hover) 
or you're using a special property-value pair (like color: red).
